WEBVTT - Some title

00:00.000 --> 00:02.865
This video will walk you through translating a HelloWorld graph. This converts the Logical Graph into a Physical Graph Template.

00:02.866 --> 00:06.622
In the Translation tab, you can find the list of all the available algorithms to translate the Logical Graph. The translation step is not performed within EAGLE, but instead using the DALiuGE translation engine.

00:06.623 --> 00:14.560
The URL for the translation engine needs to be set so the graph can be sent for translation. It might be remote, but in this case the translation engine is running locally.

00:14.561 --> 00:19.104
The choice of algorithm depends on what types of optimisations are preferred for the translation. In this case, no optimisation is chosen, since the graph is very simple.

00:19.105 --> 00:22.982
Different formats are available for the graph to be sent to the translator.

00:22.983 --> 00:29.000
The translated graph is opened in a new tab. Here you can see the HelloWorldApp and File nodes, translated into a Physical Graph Template.
