WEBVTT - Some title

00:00.000 --> 00:02.828
This video shows one way to execute a Hello World graph. In this case, the execution engine is running in a local Docker container.

00:02.829 --> 00:09.322
For this example, Algorithm 1 was chosen so that the graph would be partitioned. 

00:09.323 --> 00:17.672
The result of the translation step can be seen here, in the form of a Physical Graph Template.

00:17.673 --> 00:29.423
At the bottom of the window are some options. To execute the graph, in this case the IP address of the local computer is entered so it points to the Docker container running the execution engine (localhost will not work). Then "Generate & Deploy Physical Graph" is clicked.

00:29.424 --> 00:37.617
A new tab is opened with information about the execution of the graph. Clicking on "Graph" displays the Physical Graph.

00:37.618 --> 00:43.338
The output of the HelloWorldApp is saved to a file inside the Docker container running the execution engine. One way to access this is via the Docker Desktop dashboard.

00:43.339 --> 00:50.915
The dashboard shows a list of Docker containers, with buttons to access them in different ways. One way is to open a CLI.

00:50.916 --> 01:03.439
The file is saved in the "home" directory. With some navigation you can find it.

01:03.440 --> 01:14.000
Checking the contents of this file provides the greeting that was set in the HelloWorldApp parameters.
