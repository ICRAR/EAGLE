Settings
===================

Tabs Breakdown
--------------

**User Options**  -  General user experience options

**UI Options**  -  Settings that can simplify, hide or show sections of the UI that might not be necessary for a use case

**Advanced Editing**  -  Permission settings that unlock the ability to edit more components

**External Services**  -  This is where external services such as github and docker can be set up

**Developer**  -  Settings used by developers to debug Eagle

UI Modes
--------------

Ui modes are collections of settings creating seperate workspaces, each designed with a specific use case in mind.

**Minimal** - Designed for student use or when the goal is loading a graph, tweaking its key attributes and executing it through the translator.

**Default** - The ideal mode when deploying or editing graphs with additional information shown compared to minimal

**Graph** - Unlocks the permissions required for graph creation from pre-existing palettes and palette components

**Palette** - Being able to change all values on palette and graph components, as well as graph deployment functionality

**Expert** - Unlocks everything Eagle has to offer

**Custom** - Your mode, your way

User Options
--------------

**Confirm Discard Changes** - Prompt user to confirm that unsaved changes to the current file should be discarded when opening a new file, or when navigating away from EAGLE.

**Confirm Remove Repositories** - Prompt user to confirm removing a repository from the list of known repositories.

**Confirm Reload Palettes** - Prompt user to confirm when loading a palette that is already loaded.

**Open Default Palette on Startup** - Open a default palette on startup. The palette contains an example of all known node categories.

**Confirm Delete** - Prompt user to confirm when deleting node(s) or edge(s) from a graph.

**Disable JSON Validation** - Allow EAGLE to load/save/send-to-translator graphs and palettes that would normally fail validation against schema.

**Overwrite Existing Translator Tab** - When translating a graph, overwrite an existing translator tab.

**Show File Loading Warnings** - Display list of issues with files encountered during loading.

**UI Mode** - User Interface Mode. Simple Mode removes palettes, uses a single graph repository, simplifies the parameters table. Expert Mode enables the display of additional settings usually reserved for advanced users.


UI options
------------------------

**Show non key parameters** - Show additional parameters that are not marked as key parameters for the current graph.

**Display Node Keys** - Node keys are usually only necessary for troubleshooting purposes.

**Hide Palette Tab** - The Palette tab is not required for loading and executing graphs. Hiding it will reduce visual complexity.

**Hide Read Only Parameters** - Hide Read Only Parameters

**Translator Mode** - There are a few modes affecting the amount of permissions available:  **minimal** - using default algorithm and settings, hiding the translation tab. **Default** - using default algorithm allowing for some extra control via the translation tab. **Expert** - Offers additional translating algorithms.

**Graph Zoom Divisor** - The number by which zoom inputs are divided before being applied. Larger divisors reduce the amount of zoom.

External Services
------------------------

To save a graph to GitHub, you will need to add a repository that you have permission to write to. You may need to create a new repository if you don't already have access to one.
