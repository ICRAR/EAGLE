Ui modes are collections of settings creating seperate workspaces, each designed with a specific use case in mind.

**Minimal** - Designed for student use or when the goal is loading a graph, tweaking its key attributes and executing it through the translator.

**Default** - The ideal mode when deploying or editing graphs with additional information shown compared to minimal

**Graph** - Unlocks the permissions required for graph creation from pre-existing palettes and palette components

**Palette** - Being able to change all values on palette and graph components, as well as graph deployment functionality

This video provides detailed instructions for constructing the "Hello World" :doc:`Logical Graph Template <graphs>`. In most documentation, and the EAGLE interface, this is referred to as a graph. It is a visual depiction of the relationships between different :doc:`components <components>` integrated into a workflow. You can also directly play around with the editor and the HelloWorld example graph on our `public installation <https://eagle.icrar.org/?service=GitHub&repository=ICRAR/EAGLE-graph-repo&branch=master&path=examples&filename=HelloWorld-simple.graph>`_. The rest of this document provides a detailed description of the functionality and usage of EAGLE.
