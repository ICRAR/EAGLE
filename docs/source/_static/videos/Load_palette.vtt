WEBVTT - Some title

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This video will demonstrate how to load a palette of components from a repository.

00:03.012 --> 00:07.012
A GitHub Access Token is required to be able to access the ICRAR/EAGLE repositories. This will need the correct permissions - "read:public_key", "read:user", and "repo"

00:07.746 --> 00:10.746
To create a token, navigate to GitHub and log in to your account.

00:13.197 --> 00:19.197
You will need to go to your account settings, then to "Developer settings", and click on "Personal access tokens". This will take you to the page where you can generate a new token.

00:29.836 --> 00:35.836
Each personal access token needs a unique description, which you enter in the text box. The video will show you where to locate the required permissions.

00:44.180 --> 00:48.180
If you click the clipboard icon, it will copy the token to your clipboard. After you navigate away from this page, you will not be shown this token again. You can re-generate it later, or create a new one, but otherwise you will need to save this string somewhere safe.

00:48.842 --> 00:51.842
Back in Eagle, you may now enter the access token you have copied.

00:54.436 --> 00:57.436
Navigate to the palette file in the ICRAR/EAGLE graph repository. It will end in ".palette".

01:07.059 --> 01:10.059
The list of components from the palette will now appear in the panel that slides out from the left.
