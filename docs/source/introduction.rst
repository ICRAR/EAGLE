EAGLE is an interface designed to streamline and simplify workflow development, and as much as possible create a clear separation of different concerns and operational constraints. For both EAGLE and DALiuGE, a major aim is to allow code to be as re-usable as possible, while still enabling highly optimised and integrated ways of implementing or migrating algorithms. They are also concerned with optimising the granularity and potential parallelism of workflows.
