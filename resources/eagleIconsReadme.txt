The eagleIcons.json file is a project file used by the custom icon font web application we have been using to create our custom fonts. 
The web app is called (iconmoon.io) and the json file can be uploaded there to edit our existing font project.

if any changes are made, the project should be re-downloaded and replaced here. 
Any icons files svgs that are edited or added should also be placed here (in the resources folder) for easy future use and editing.
